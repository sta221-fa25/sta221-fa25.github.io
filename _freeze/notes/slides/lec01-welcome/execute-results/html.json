All group members are expected to participate equally. Commit history may be used to give individual team members different grades. Your grade may differ from the rest of your group.\n\n## Sharing / reusing code\n\n-   The use of online resources (including generative AI, as well as static webpages like Stack-Overflow, etc.) is strictly prohibited on in-class quizzes and exams. For take home assignments, you may make use of online resources for coding portions on assignments. If you directly use code from a source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. If you used generative AI to create the code, you should include your prompt(s) in your citation as well.\n\n-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source.\n\n-   Narrative (non-code solutions) should always be entirely your own.\n\n::: callout-warning\nExtensive use of AI on take-home assessments will likely set you up for poor performance on graded in-class assignments.\n:::\n\n## Late policy\n\n-   Homeworks and labs can be turned in within 48 hours of the deadline for grade penalty (5% off per day).\n\n-   Exams and the final project cannot be turned in late and can only be excused under exceptional circumstances.\n\n-   The Duke policy for illness requires a short-term illness report or a letter from the Dean; except in emergencies, all other absenteeism must be approved in advance (e.g., an athlete who must miss class may be excused by prior arrangement for specific days). For emergencies, email notification is needed at the first reasonable time.\n\n-   Last minute coding/rendering issues will not be granted extensions.\n\n## Course toolkit\n\n| Resource | Description |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| [course website](https://sta221-fa25.github.io/) | course notes, deadlines, assignments, office hours, syllabus |\n| [Canvas](https://go.canvas.duke.edu) | class recordings, solutions, announcements, Ed Discussion |\n| [course organization](https://github.com/sta221-fa25) | assignments, collaboration |\n| [RStudio containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers)\\* | online coding platform |\n\n\\*You are welcome to install R and RStudio locally on your computer.
