## Learning objectives



## Example 

The data set comes from @zarulli2021 who analyze the effects of a country's healthcare expenditures and other factors on the country's life expectancy. The data are originally from the [Human Development Database](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) and [World Health Organization](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/).

There are `r nrow(life_exp)` countries (observations) in the data set.

<br>

**Goal: Use the income inequality in a country to understand variability in the life expectancy.**
