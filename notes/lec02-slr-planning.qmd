<!-- | x | "predictor", "covariate", "feature", "independent variable", when capitalized "X" is sometimes referred to as the "data matrix" | -->
<!-- | $\beta$ | "population parameter", "constants", "coefficients", $\beta_0$ is often called "the intercept". These are *fixed* numbers. | -->
<!-- | $\epsilon$ | the "error". This quantity represents observational error, i.e.Â the difference between our observation and the true population-level expected value | -->
