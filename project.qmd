## Description

The goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing. The data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.

Choose the data based on your group's interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.

**All analyses must be done in RStudio using Quarto and GitHub, and your analysis and written report must be reproducible.**

## Deliverables

You will work on the project with your lab groups. The primary deliverables for the project are

1. an in-person presentation about the exploratory data analysis and initial modeling

2. a written, reproducible final report detailing your analysis

3. a summary of your project highlights to share with the class

4. a GitHub repository containing all work from the project

There are intermediate milestones and peer review assignments throughout the semester to help you work towards the primary deliverables.

# Step 1 

## Research topics

The goal of this milestone is to discuss topics and develop potential research questions your team is interested in investigating for the project. You are only developing ideas at this point; you do not need to have a data set identified right now.

Develop three potential research topics. Include the following for each topic:

1. A brief description of the topic
2. A statement about your motivation for investigating this topic
3. The potential audience(s), i.e., who might be most interested in this research? 
4. Two or three potential research questions you could analyze about this topic. (Note: These are draft questions at this point. You will finalize the questions in the next stage of the project.)
5. Ideas about the type of data you might use to answer this question or potential data sets you're interested in using. (Note: The goal is to generate ideas at this point, so it is fine if you have not identified any particular data sets at this point.)

**Turn-in:** Write your responses in `research-topics.qmd` in your team’s project GitHub repo. Push the `qmd` and rendered `pdf` documents to GitHub by the deadline, **Tuesday, September 30 at 5:00pm**. There is no Gradescope submission.

## Project proposal

The purpose of the project proposal is for your team to identify the data set you're interested in analyzing to investigate one of your potential research topics. You will also do some preliminary exploration of the response variable and begin thinking about the modeling strategy. If you’re unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources [here](/project-data.html) as a starting point.

::: callout-important
You must use the data set(s) in the proposal for the final project, unless instructed otherwise when given feedback.
:::

The data set must meet the following criteria:

-   At least 500 observations

-   At least 10 columns, such that at least 6 of the columns are useful and unique predictor variables.

    -   e.g., identifier variables such as "name", "ID number", etc. are <u>not</u> useful predictor variables.

    -   e.g., if you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. "state abbreviation" and "state name"), then they are not unique predictors.

-   At least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.

    -   The response variable can be quantitative or categorical.

-   A mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.

-   May not be data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.


The project proposal should include the following:

1. A statement of a research question. 
2. Why your research question is important.
3. A description of your data 
4. A description of how your data will be used to answer your research question
5. A description of your planned analysis (what is the outcome variable, relevant predictors, regression technique, e.g. multiple linear regression for continuous outcome vs logistic regression for a binary outcome). We will cover logistic regression in the coming weeks but you can read ahead about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression).

**Turn-in:** submit a pdf proposal to Gradescope by the deadline.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The purpose of this milestone is to explore the data early and get  feedback on your data and analyses. You will submit a draft of the beginning of your report that includes the introduction and exploratory data analysis, with an emphasis on the EDA. It will also help you prepare for the presentation of the exploratory data analysis results.

Below is a brief description of the sections to include in this step:

### Introduction

This section includes an introduction to the project motivation, background, data, and research question.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

This section includes the following:

- Description of the data set and key variables.

- Exploratory data analysis of the response variable and key predictor variables. This includes visualizations, summary statistics, and narrative. Include:
        
  - Univariate EDA of the response and key predictor variables.
  - Bivariate EDA of the response and key predictor variables
  - Potential interaction effects
  
**Turn-in:** Write your draft introduction and exploratory data analysis in the `report.qmd` file in your team’s GitHub repo. Push the `qmd` and rendered pdf documents to GitHub by the deadline.

Because this question is often asked: how long should this section of the report be? Usually, the anticipated length of the EDA section, including all graphs, tables, narrative, etc. with code, warnings, and messages **suppressed** is about 3-5 pages. If you exceed the limit, format your figures to be smaller. 

## Presentations

Your team will do an in-person presentation that summarizes and showcases the work you’ve done on the project thus far. Because the presentations will take place while you’re still working on the project, it will also be an opportunity to receive feedback and suggestions as well as provide feedback to other teams. The presentation will focus on introducing the subject matter and research question, showcase key results from the exploratory data analysis, and discuss primary modeling strategies and/or results. The presentation should be supported by slides that serve as a brief visual addition to the presentation. The presentation and slides will be graded for content and clarity.

You can create your slides with any software you like (e.g., Keynote, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.). You can also use Quarto to make your slides! While we won’t be covering making slides with Quarto in the class, we would be happy to help you with it in office hours. It’s no different than writing other documents with Quarto, so the learning curve will not be steep!

The presentation is expected to be between 5 to 6 minutes. It may not exceed 6 minutes.

Every team member is expected to speak in the presentation. Part of the grade will be whether every team member had a meaningful speaking role in the presentation.

Suggested template:

Slides

The slide deck should have no more than 5 content slides + 1 title slide to ensure you have enough time to discuss each slide. Here is a suggested outline as you think through the slides; you do not have to use this exact format for the 6 slides.

- Title Slide

- Slide 1: Introduce the subject, motivation, and research question

- Slide 2: Introduce the data set

- Slide 3 - 4: Highlights from the EDA (be sure to include EDA for the response variable!)

- Slide 5: Initial modeling strategies / results (if applicable) / next steps and anything you'd like feedback on

**Turn-in:** Put a PDF of the slides in a folder entitled "presentation" in your team's GitHub repo. Push the slides before your lab section on the presentation day.
