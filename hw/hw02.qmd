# Conceptual exercises

The conceptual exercises are focused on explaining concepts and showing results mathematically. Show your work for each question.

You may write the answers and associated work for conceptual exercises by hand or type them in your Quarto document.

## Exercise 1

Derive the expected value and covariance matrix of the residual vector, $\hbe$. In other words, derive the $E[\hbe | \bX]$ and $\text{var}(\hbe | \bX)$.

Hint: consider the hat matrix.

## Exercise 2

Show $E\left[\frac{\text{RSS}}{n-2}\right]$ is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$.

## Exercise 3

Show that if $\bar{x} > 0$, $\text{cov}(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1) < 0$ in simple linear regression.

## Exercise 4 

Because the least squares estimator $\hat{\beta} = \bA \by$, for some matrix $\bA$, we call $\hat{\beta}$ a *linear* estimator.

If $E[\be] = \bzero$ and $\text{var}(\be) = \sigma^2 \identity$, then show (a) that $E[\hat{\beta}] = \beta$ and (b) that $\hat{\beta}$ has *the smallest* variance among all linear, unbiased estimators.

Hint for part (b): consider an alternative linear estimator $\tilde{\beta} = \boldsymbol{B} \by$ and show that its variance is equal to the variance of $\hat{\beta}$ plus some positive semi-definite matrix.


## Exercise 5



# Submission

::: callout-warning
Remember -- you must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page before the submission deadline for full credit.

If you write your responses to conceptual exercises by hand, you will need to combine your written work to the completed PDF for the applied exercises before submitting on Gradescope.

Instructions to combine PDFs:

To submit your assignment:

-   Access Gradescope through the menu on the Canvas website.

-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.

-   Mark the pages associated with each exercise. All of the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be “checked”).

-   Select the first page of your .PDF submission to be associated with the *"Workflow & formatting"* section.

The "Workflow & formatting" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow and document format for the applied exercises. This includes a neatly organized document with readable code and your name and the date updated in the YAML.
