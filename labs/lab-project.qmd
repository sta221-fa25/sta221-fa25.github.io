## Today's lab

The goal of today's lab is to begin your project proposal.

1. read the entire project description [here](/project.html) or by clicking the tab "project" at the top of the website.

2. navigate to your GitHub repo `project-team_name` in the course organization and clone the repo. 

3. edit `research-topics.qmd`. Push the `qmd` and rendered `pdf` documents to GitHub by the deadline: **Tuesday, September 30 at 5:00pm**. There is no Gradescope submission. This exercise will be graded according to the following rubric:

- 0pts: missing or severely incomplete `research-topics`
- 1pt: somewhat incomplete `research-topics` 
- 2pts: each itemized point is thoroughly addressed for each topic

4. After you complete this write-up, begin to plan your project proposal.
