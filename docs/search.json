Students will develop computing skills to implement a reproducible data analysis workflow and gain experience communicating statistical results. Throughout the semester, students will work on a team project where they will develop a research question, answer it using methods learned in the course, and share results through a written report and presentation.\nTopics include applications of linear and logistic regression, least squares estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, analysis of variance, model diagnostics, and model selection. Students will gain experience using the computing tools R and GitHub to analyze real-world data from a variety of fields.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nEither any STA 100-level course or STA 230, 231, or 240L and MATH 216, 218, or 221. The recommended co-requisite is STA 230, 231, or 240L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse material\nThere is no official textbook for the course; readings will be made available as they are assigned. We will use the statistical software package R both in-class, and on take-home assignments in this course. R is freely available at http://www.r-project.org/. RStudio, the popular IDE for R, is freely available at https://posit.co/downloads/. Additionally, students may access R and RStudio through Docker containers provided by Duke Office of Information Technology. Containers can be accessed at https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers.\n\n\nCourse learning objectives\nBy the end of the semester, you will be able to‚Ä¶\n\nanalyze data to explore real-world multivariable relationships.\nfit, interpret, and draw conclusions from linear and logistic regression models.\nimplement a reproducible analysis workflow using R for analysis, Quarto to write reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.\nexplain the mathematical foundations of linear and logistic regression.\neffectively communicate statistical results to a general audience.\nassess the ethical considerations and implications of analysis decisions.\n\n\n\nEvaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nHomework (25%)\nIndividual take-home assignments, submitted to Gradescope.\n\n\nMidterms (45%)\nTwo exams with an in-class and take-home component.\n\n\nFinal project (15%)\nTeam-based final project.\n\n\nQuizzes (5%)\nIn-class pop-quizzes.\n\n\nLabs (10%)\nExercises assigned in lab, submitted to Gradescope.\n\n\n\nA \\(&gt;= 93\\), A- \\(&lt; 93\\), B+ \\(&lt; 90\\), B \\(&lt; 87\\), B- \\(&lt; 83\\), C+ \\(&lt;80\\), C \\(&lt; 77\\), C- \\(&lt; 73\\), D+ \\(&lt; 70\\), D \\(&lt; 67\\), D- \\(&lt; 63\\), F \\(&lt; 60\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on quizzes\n\n\n\nOn pseudo-random class days, there will be a brief quiz on the previous lectures. If you score \\(&gt;60\\%\\) cumulatively on your final quiz grade, you will receive full participation credit. Your lowest two quizzes will also be dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\nAcademic integrity\nBy enrolling in this course, you commit to upholding Duke‚Äôs community standard reproduced as follows:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\nAny violations of academic integrity will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action. For the Exams and Quizzes, students are required to work alone. For the Homework assignments, students may work with a study group but each student must write up and submit their own answers.\n\nLate work\nLate homework may be submitted within 48 hours of the assignment deadline. Late homework submitted within 24 hours (even 1 minute late) will receive a 5% late penalty. Late work submitted between 24 to 48 hours of the deadline will receive a 10% late penalty. Work submitted after 48 hours will not be accepted. Exams cannot be turned in late and can only be excused under exceptional circumstances. The Duke policy for illness requires a short-term illness report or a letter from the Dean; except in emergencies, all other absenteeism must be approved in advance (e.g., an athlete who must miss class may be excused by prior arrangement for specific days). For emergencies, email notification is needed at the first reasonable time.\nOutside resources and generative AI statement\nThe use of online resources (including generative AI, as well as static webpages like Stack-Overflow, etc.) is strictly prohibited on in-class assignments. For take home assignments, you may make use of online resources for coding portions on assignments. If you directly use code from a source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. If you used generative AI to create the code, you should include your prompt(s) in your citation as well. Any code that is discovered to be recycled or created by AI and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nExtensive use of AI on take-home assessments will likely set you up for poor performance on graded in-class assignments.\n\n\nErrors in grading\nErrors in grading must be brought to the attention of the TA or instructor during office hours within 1 week of receiving the grade."

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke‚Äôs Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can find instructions to do so here. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity‚Äôs website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website, sta221-sp25.netlify.app.\nLinks to Zoom meetings may be found in Canvas. Periodic announcements will be sent via email and will also be available through Ed Discussion and Canvas Announcements. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have questions about assignment extensions, accommodations, or any other matter not appropriate for the class discussion forum, please email me directly at maria.tackett@duke.edu. If you email me, please include ‚ÄúSTA 221‚Äù in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 221 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday."

As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you‚Äôre not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings and other preparation work.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It‚Äôs not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon‚Äôt procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don‚Äôt let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "text": "What to expect in the course\n\nLectures and labs\nLectures and labs are designed to be interactive, so you gain experience applying new concepts and learning from each other. My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities during the lectures and labs. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or any device with internet and a keyboard to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.\n\n\nTeams\nYou will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the group activities, labs and the final project. You will be asked to complete teamwork evaluations and self-reflections throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment can result in a penalty to your score relative to the team‚Äôs overall mark.\nYou are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as one of several metrics of each team member‚Äôs relative contribution for each project."

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation and communication. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team‚Äôs Git repository in the course‚Äôs GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member‚Äôs relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you‚Äôve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks and explain the underlying mathematics. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you‚Äôre learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes in-class component and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you‚Äôve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the applied and mathematical content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The exams will be based on content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homework, and lab assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you‚Äôve learned to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work through a written report and presentation. More information about the project will be provided during the semester. You can learn more on the final project page.\n\n\nParticipation (Application exercises + teamwork)\n\nApplication exercises\nYou will get the most out of the course if you actively participate in class and when working with your team. Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). AEs are submitted by pushing your work to the relevant GitHub repo.\nAEs will be graded based on making a good-faith effort to attempt all questions covered in class. You are welcome to, but not required, to work on AEs beyond lecture.\nSuccessful effort on at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nTeamwork\nGiven the collaborative nature of statistics and data science work, teamwork will be a key part of this course. You will work in teams for in-class activities, lab assignments, and the final course project. There will be periodic peer and self-evaluations to reflect on the team‚Äôs collaboration. These evaluations will be counted as part of the participation grade."

Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don‚Äôt cheat!\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what‚Äôs the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g.¬†StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:2 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate‚Äîrather than hinder‚Äîlearning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one‚Äôs own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback in a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email me at maria.tackett@duke.edu before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your lab team. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your lab TA and teammates about how you can make up your contribution. If you know you‚Äôre going to miss a lab session and you‚Äôre feeling well enough to do so, notify your lab TA and teammates ahead of time.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\n\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture‚Äôs video, please fill out the form at the link below. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean‚Äôs excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\nüîó https://forms.office.com/r/rvsgNcumRy\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students.
